# **==== Sprites ====**

----

Previously, we were loading a whole image and drawing it to the screen, but what if we want something animated? An array of images would be annoying to work with (though technically doable, and even preferable in some rare cases), but the best way to handle this is a sprite.

A sprite is simply an image consisting of multiple frames used to represent an object or character in cyberspace. The image file that stores a sprites frames is the sprite sheet.
